Usaremos la caracterización de convergencia en distribución de [[IE - Teorico 8#^7ca736]] (parte d): para cualquier conjunto cerrado $F$, se debe cumplir que $\\overline{\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty}} P(Y_n \\in F) \\le P(Y_0 \\in F)$.\n>>3. Sea $F \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m$ un conjunto cerrado cualquiera y $\\varepsilon > 0$. Podemos acotar la probabilidad $P(Y_n \\in F)$ de la siguiente manera: $$\\begin{align} P(Y_n \\in F) & \\le P(Y_n \\in F, ||Y_n - Y_0|| \\le \\varepsilon) + P(Y_{n}\\in F,||Y_n - Y_0|| > \\varepsilon)\\\\ & \\leq P(Y_n \\in F, ||Y_n - Y_0|| \\le \\varepsilon) + P(||Y_n - Y_0|| > \\varepsilon)\\end{align}$$\n>>4. Notemos que si $Y_n \\in F$ y $||Y_n - Y_0|| \\le \\varepsilon$ entonces $Y_0$ debe pertenecer al \"ensanchamiento\" de $F$, es decir, al conjunto $F^\\varepsilon = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^m : d(y, F) \\le \\varepsilon\\}$. Por que $d(Y_{0},F)\\leq ||Y_{0}-Y_{n}||\\leq \\epsilon$ por que la norma es un infimo de un conjunto $F$ que contiene a $Y_{n}$ (Notar que abuse de notacion y aca seria todo pensando $Y_{n}(w)$) \n>>5. Por lo tanto, el evento $\\{Y_n \\in F, ||Y_n - Y_0|| \\le \\varepsilon\\}$ está contenido en el evento $\\{Y_0 \\in F^\\varepsilon\\}$.\n>>6.

Como $Y_n \\xrightarrow{P} Y_0$, el segundo término es 0. Así, obtenemos: $$\\overline{\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}} P(Y_n \\in F) \\le P(Y_0 \\in F^\\varepsilon)$$\n>>9. Esta relación es válida para cualquier $\\varepsilon > 0$. Como $F$ es cerrado, cuando $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, los conjuntos $F^\\varepsilon$ decrecen hacia $F$.\n>>10. Por la continuidad de la probabilidad, $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} P(Y_0 \\in F^\\varepsilon) = P(Y_0 \\in F)$.\n>>11.

(ósea el experimento de fondo sigue una $X\\sim Ber(\\theta)$ entonces las muestras que tomemos serán binomiales) Y tenemos el problema de hipótesis:\n>$$H_0: \\theta = 0.5\\ \\text{ vs }\\ H_1: \\theta \\ne 0.5$$\n>¿Podemos encontrar un test UMP-$\\alpha$ para este problema?. Si uno plantea el problema unilateral:\n>$$H_0: \\theta=0.5\\ \\text{ vs }\\ H_1^+: \\theta > 0.5$$\n>Para este problema sabemos encontrar el test UMP-$\\alpha$, que es de la forma:\n>$$ \\varphi^+(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{si } x > k^+ \\\\ \\gamma^+ & \\text{si } x = k^+ \\\\ 0 & \\text{si } x < k^+ \\end{cases} $$\n>donde $k^+$ y $\\gamma^+$ se determinan para asegurar que $\\alpha = E_{0.5}[\\varphi^+(X)]$.\n>\n>Si uno considera el problema:\n>$$H_0: \\theta=0.5\\ \\text{ vs }\\ H_1^-: \\theta < 0.5$$\n>El test MP para $H_0$ vs $H_1^-$ es de la forma:\n>$$ \\varphi^-(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{si } x < k^- \\\\ \\gamma^- & \\text{si } x = k^- \\\\ 0 & \\text{si } x > k^- \\end{cases} $$\n>donde $\\gamma^-$ y $k^-$ se eligen de forma tal que $\\alpha = E_{0.5}[\\varphi^-(X)]$.\n>\n>Supongamos que tenemos el test UMP-$\\alpha$ para el problema bilateral, y lo llamamos $\\varphi^0$.\n>Entonces, $\\varphi^0$ es el más potente para el problema de hipótesis $$H_0: \\theta=0.5\\ \\text{ vs }\\ H_1^+: \\theta > 0.5$$\n>Esto implica que las funciones de potencia deben ser iguales:\n>$$ \\beta_{\\varphi^0}(\\theta) = \\beta_{\\varphi^+}(\\theta) \\quad \\forall \\theta \\ge 0.5 $$\n>$$ E_\\theta[\\varphi^0(X)] =\\beta_{\\varphi^0}(\\theta) = \\beta_{\\varphi^+}(\\theta) = E_\\theta[\\varphi^+(X)] \\quad \\forall \\theta \\ge 0.5 $$\n>\n>Sea $g^+(x) = \\varphi^0(x) - \\varphi^+(x)$.

en el problema particular que estemos analizando. Es una decisión en términos de lo que se considere el interés en el fenómeno bajo estudio. Veamos el siguiente ejemplo.\n\n>[!Example]\n>Supongamos que estudiamos una nueva droga que deseamos saber si aumenta la tasa de recuperación resp. de tratamientos anteriores. Supongamos que de la experiencia con las drogas anteriores, la tasa de recuperación es $\\theta_0 = 0.3$.\n>El científico que descubre la nueva droga quiere minimizar el error de decir que la nueva droga es mejor cuando eso no ocurre (1) .\n>Hay dos posibles errores que uno puede cometer:\n>- \"Decir que la nueva droga es mejor que la anterior cuando esto no ocurre\"\n>- \"Decir que la nueva droga es igual que las anteriores cuando esto no ocurre\"\n>\n>Equivalentemente:\n>- Decir que $\\theta > 0.3$ cuando $\\theta = 0.3$ (2)\n>- Decir que $\\theta = 0.3$ cuando $\\theta > 0.3$\n>\n>En términos del interés del científico (1) , entonces lo que planteamos como problema de hipótesis es:\n>$$H_0: \\theta=0.3\\ \\text{ vs }\\ H_1: \\theta>0.3$$\n>que es equivalente a rechazar $H_0$ (decir que $\\theta > 0.3$) siendo $H_0$ verdadera (2) (o sea cdo la nueva droga no es más eficiente).\n>\n>Se realiza entonces una experiencia donde se toma una muestra aleatoria de la población enferma, donde se administra la nueva droga. Se obtiene una muestra $X=(X_1, \\dots, X_n)^t$ donde $X_i \\sim Bi(1, \\theta)$, $i=1, \\dots, n$ independientes. Sea $S = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ el número de pacientes recuperados con la nueva droga, $S \\sim Bi(n, \\theta)$. \n>Para plantear una región de rechazo para construir el test, observamos que la f.d.a de $S$, $P_\\theta(S \\le k) = F_\\theta(k)$ es decreciente en $\\theta \\in (0,1)$ para cada $k$ fijado. (es un resultado que se puede probar).\n>Luego, $S$ tiende a producir valores más grandes a medida que $\\theta$ crece, con lo cual podríamos decir: Rechazar $H_0$ si $S$ es más \"grande\" de lo que hubieramos esperado por azar si $H_0: \\theta=0.3$ es verdadera. Entonces la región de rechazo resultaría: $$C = \\{x\\in \\Omega_{X}: S(x) > k\\}$$, con $k$ a determinar, y el test resultaría:\n>$$ \\varphi(x) = I_{\\{k, k+1, \\dots, n\\}}(S)= \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{si } x \\in C \\\\ 0 & \\text{si } x \\notin C \\end{cases} $$\n>$k$ se determina usando la condición de nivel $\\alpha$:\n>$$ \\beta_\\varphi(\\theta_0) =\\sup_{P\\in \\mathcal{P}_{0}}E_{P}(\\varphi(x))= E_{\\theta_0}[\\varphi] = P_{\\theta_0}(S > k) \\le \\alpha $$\n>(supremo se simplifica por que hay un solo elemento en el conjunto $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$) \n>La idea es determinar \"$k$\" de forma que $P_{\\theta_0}(S > k)$ sea \"chico\" (porque entonces es \"chico\" el ETI que queremos controlar).\n>\n>Para fijar ideas, supongamos en nuestro caso que $n=10$ y $\\theta_0=0.3$\n>Al buscar en tablas o con un paquete estadístico vemos por ejemplo que\n>Tomando $k=5$ resulta que\n>$$ P_{0.3}(S > 5) = 0.0473 $$\n>En este caso, como $\\mathcal{P}_0 = \\{P_{0.3}\\}$, el supremo se alcanza en el único elemento del conjunto:\n>$$ \\sup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}_0} E_P[\\varphi(X)] = E_{0.3}[\\varphi(\\underline{X})] = P_{0.3}(S > 5) $$\n>\"$k$\" recibe el nombre de **valor crítico**. Luego, el test es definido por\n>$$ \\varphi(X_1, \\dots, X_n) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{si } S > 5 \\\\ 0 & \\text{si } S \\le 5 \\end{cases} $$\n>y $\\{S > 5\\}$ es la **región crítica**, produce un test de tamaño $0.0473$.\n>\n>Ademas Notar\n>![[Pasted image 20250726164154.png]]\n>Que la función de potencia $\\beta_\\varphi(\\theta)$ tienda a 1 a medida que $\\theta$ crece a 1 es una buena propiedad del test.\n>Si nos fijamos en nuestro ejemplo, el test construido se basó en el estadístico $S$, el cual recibe el nombre de **estadístico del test**.\n\n>[!Remark]\n>Vayamos ahora al caso más sencillo posible de plantear:\n>$$ H_0: \\mathcal{P}_0 = \\{P_0\\} \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: \\mathcal{P}_1 = \\{P_1\\} $$\n>(el caso de **\"hipótesis simples\"**).\n>\n>La pregunta que queremos resolver es:\n>Dado $\\alpha < 1$, ¿podemos encontrar un test $\\varphi$ de tamaño $\\alpha$ tal que su potencia en $P_1$ sea mayor o igual que la potencia de cualquier otro test con nivel de significación $\\alpha$?\n\n>[!Definition] Test MP\n>Un test $\\varphi$ para el problema $H_0: \\mathcal{P}_0=\\{P_0\\}$ vs $H_1: \\mathcal{P}_1=\\{P_1\\}$ se dice **más potente (MP)** de tamaño $\\alpha$ si\n>- i) $\\beta_\\varphi(P_0) = \\alpha$ \n>- ii) Para todo test $\\varphi'$ tal que $\\beta_{\\varphi'}(P_0) \\le \\alpha$, se tiene que $\\beta_{\\varphi'}(P_1) \\le

Sabemos que son suficientes y completos, y como son insesgados deben ser IMVU por el teorema de Lehmann-Scheffé. Por otro lado se cumplen las condiciones para que valga la desigualdad de Rao-Cramer. Cuando calculamos la matriz de información asociada al vector $X = (X_1, \\dots, X_n)$ resulta ser la matriz ser\n>$$ I^{-1}(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n>\n>Por Rao-Cramer entonces $V_\\theta(\\hat{\\mu}) \\ge \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$ y $V_\\theta(S^2) \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n}$. En el primer caso, la desigualdad es exactamente una igualdad, lo que daría otra forma para concluir que la media muestral es IMVU, porque alcanza exactamente la minima cota posible. Sin embargo la segunda desigualdad es estricta porque $V_\\theta(S^2) = \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-1} > \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n}$ o sea que la cota inferior no es alcanzada, por lo cual no es por este

miremos: $\\{X_n\\}$ sucesion de v.a $X_n \\sim N(0, \\frac{1}{n})$\n>1. $E X_n = 0 \\quad V (X_n) = \\frac{1}{n}$\n>2. Viendo el grafico de esta sucesion un creeria que el limite es $X\\equiv0$\n>3. Veamos que $F_{X_n}(t) \\rightarrow F_X(t)$ con $$F_X(t) = P(X \\leq t) = \\begin{cases}0 & t < 0 \\\\1 & t \\geq 0\\end{cases}$$\n>4. $$F_{X_n}(t) = P(X_n \\leq t) = P\\left( \\frac{X_n}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}}} \\leq \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}}} \\right)=\\Phi(\\sqrt{ n }t)\\rightarrow \\begin{cases}0 & t < 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & t = 0 \\\\ 1 & t > 0 \n\\end{cases}$$ \n>Esto vale por que $\\Phi$ es la acumulada de una estandar osea $N(0,1)$  \n>5.

descripcion\n\n>[!Remark]- Introduccion\n>Supongamos que realizamos $n$ repeticion o ensayos de un cierto experimento (independientes) para obtener el valor de una cantidad fisica desconocida $\\mu$. Obtenemos $x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n}$ que son realizaciones de las v.a $X_{1},\\ldots , X_{n}$ tal que toman la forma $X_{j}=\\mu +\\epsilon_{j}$ con $\\epsilon_{1},\\ldots,\\epsilon_{j}$ v.a (no observadas) que se suelen denominar errores aleatorios.\n>Algunos supuestos, segun el fenomeno que estamos haciendo:\n>- (i)  El valor de un error no afecta la aparicion de los errores cometidos en otros ensayos (osea $\\epsilon_{1},\\ldots,\\epsilon_{j}$ son indeptes)\n>- (ii) La distribucion de los errores se mantiene cte a lo largo de $n$ ensayos realizados (osea $\\epsilon_{1},\\ldots,\\epsilon _{n}$ son identicamente distribuidas)\n>- (iii) La distribucion del error no depende de $\\mu$\n>Con estos supuestos podemos hablar de que $X_{1},\\ldots,X_{n}$ son v.a.i.i.d y que lo que queremos es estimar el paramtro $\\mu$ de una variable aleatoria $X$ con $X\\sim X_{i}$ \n>Ahora si tenemos $G$ f.d.a de $\\epsilon_{i}$'s entonces que distribucion tienen $X_{i}$'s ?\n>$$F_{X_{i}}(t)=F_{X_{1}}(t)=P(X_{1}\\leq t)=P(\\mu +\\epsilon_{1}\\leq t)=P(\\epsilon_{1}\\leq t-\\mu )=G(t-\\mu)$$\n>Por lo tanto notemos $$P(X_{1}\\leq t_{1}\\cap\\ldots\\cap X_{n}\\leq t_{n})=\\prod^{n} P(X_{i}\\leq t_{i})=\\prod^{n} G(t_{i}-\\mu)$$\n>Ahora como no sabemos que valor real tiene el parametro $\\mu$ armamos un conjunto \n>$$\\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{X=\\begin{pmatrix}X_{1}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\X_{n}\\end{pmatrix}\\sim \\prod^{n} G(\\cdot-\\tilde{\\mu}): \\tilde{\\mu}\\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}$$\n>Segun que $G$ tomemos tendremos diferentes conjuntos $\\mathcal{P}$ de distribuciones que regulan a $X_{1},\\ldots,X_{n}$.\n>- (iv) Asumir una distribucion para $G$ \n\n>[!Example]\n>Si suponemos $G\\sim N(0,\\sigma^{2})$ con $\\sigma^{2}$ desconocido (o no). Entonces el conjunto $\\mathcal{P}$ de distribuciones que expresan 3 supuestos del problema puede resumirse de la siguiente forma\n>$$\\begin{align}P(X_{1}\\leq t_{1}\\cap\\ldots\\cap X_{n}\\leq t_{n})&=\\prod^{n} P(X_{i}\\leq t_{i})=\\prod P(\\epsilon_{i}\\leq t_{i}-\\mu )\\\\&=\\prod P\\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_{i}}{\\sigma}\\leq \\frac{t_{i}-\\mu}{\\sigma}  \\right)\\\\&=\\prod^{n} \\phi\\left( \\frac{t_{i}-\\mu }{\\sigma} \\right)\\end{align}$$\n>Y recordemos $\\phi\\left( \\frac{t_{i}-\\mu}{\\sigma}  \\right)$ es la acumulada de ${} X\\sim N(\\mu ,\\sigma^{2}) {}$  \n>Por lo tanto $$\\mathcal{P}=\\bigg\\{ X=\\begin{pmatrix}X_{1}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\X_{n}\\end{pmatrix}\\sim N_{n}\\bigg(\\tilde{\\mu} \\mathbb{1},\\sigma^{2} Id_{n}\\bigg) : \\tilde{\\mu }\\in \\mathbb{R} \\ ,\\ \\sigma^{2}>0\\bigg\\}\\quad\\mathbb{1}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n>Si fijamos $\\sigma^{2}$ estariamos fijando el error.

\\theta\\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}$ con $\\mathcal{P}$ conjunto de funciones de distribucion que sea suryectiva. \n>*Modelo* se le dice a la parametrizacion con el conjunto $\\mathcal{P}$. \n>$\\Theta$
